//! Diagnostics over shapes admission accepts but that grant nothing, or
//! nothing durable.
//!
//! Audit never rejects a write — that stays admission's job — and it is
//! deliberately bounded: every entry point takes a [`AuditScope`] naming one
//! Organization (or every live one) and a finding cap, and never scans the
//! whole store. Detectors are ordinary functions, named one per
//! [`FindingCategory`] row, so each can be exercised on its own; the only
//! thing [`AuthorizationEngine::audit`] adds is loading the binding facts
//! once per tier and running them in a fixed order.
