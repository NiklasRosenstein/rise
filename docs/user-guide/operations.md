# Operations for Users

This section focuses on operational tasks that application teams commonly perform in Rise.

Use these pages to:

- Build and package container images for deployment
- Diagnose and resolve common runtime, auth, and build issues

These workflows are user-facing and do not require maintaining Rise platform infrastructure.
