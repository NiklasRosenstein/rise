# Integrations (Advanced)

This section covers integration workflows for teams that need to connect Rise with external identity and deployment systems.

Use these pages when you need to:

- Configure OAuth extension workflows for your applications
- Work with container registry-backed image delivery patterns
- Integrate Rise into broader platform or CI/CD ecosystems

If you only need basic deployment workflows, start with Getting Started and Deployments first.
